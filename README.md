## About the Project
This is my first professional website project built as a second-year student at the University of Dodoma.  
I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Health Information Sciences.

This project was developed following strict HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript standards, ensuring semantic structure, accessibility, SEO optimization, and responsive design.
